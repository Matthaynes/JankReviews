                    <p>Fortnite Battle Royale is an online game where you jump out of a battle bus on to a map filled with guns and chests where you can get guns. The goal is to kill other teams(if you play in a team mode if playing in solo mode you will kill other solos) and be the last team/solo standing. When a player or team is the last one standing they have won and got a "Victory Royale".</p>

                    <h1>Strategies</h1>
                    <p>When Fortnite Battle Royale started there was no strategies it was just an all out battle and most of the time with no building and even less editing. As the days and months went on people started to get better and people started to make strategies. Some of the first and more imfamous strategies were bush camping which was when you would crouch in a bush and wait until a lot of people died so that you could survive. Another imfamous strategy was building a sky base which was when you would build up the build limit and then you would stay up high for the whole game and only move to move to the circle. These strategies are not very feasible anyone because everyone got so good. The building, editing, and shooting has gotten so advanced, it is hard to keep up with the meta(the best strategy). This is why Fortnite Battle Royale has lost a lot of people, once you take a break from the game and come back everyone is so much better than you and so you get destroyed and that is not fun.

              <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
              <p>Chapter 1 was the very beginning of Fortnite Battle Royale and is widely considered the pinnacle of Fortnite Battle Royale. Everyone loved the very first seasons but by season 7 people were getting tired of Fortnite Battle Royale and started to quit. It pretty much became a trend to quit Fortnite Battle Royale and to hate on the people who still played.</p>

              <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
              <p>Chapter 2 was a fresh start, figuratively and literally becuase they made a new map, many people came back and started to actually like it again. On the other hand, many people were still on the trend of hating on Fortnite Battle Royale. By the middle of Chapter 2 so many people had come back and started to play again.</p>

              <p>Chapter 3 is the season that we are in now, they have added a lot of new things and even more people are coming back. The new chapter is looking pretty promising, the new season has a lot of new things like tanks and new mechanics/movement, they also unvaulted a lot of things.
