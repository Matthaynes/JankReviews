                    <p>Risk of Rain 2 starts you off in the main menu, and selecting a mode will bring you to a character select screen.
                      Thanks to a recent update, you have immediate access to two characters, the Commando and Huntress.
                      You can also choose a difficulty and choose from unlockable items called artifacts that will affect your run in one way or another.
                      From making every enemy on a stage an elemental "elite" version, to majorly lowering your health in exchange for a lot more damage, the artifacts are fun to mess around with.

              <p> After choosing a character, you are thrusted into the world of Risk of Rain 2.
                There are multiple first stages that you can start off in Risk of Rain.
                You'll fight through many enemies and gain coins to open chests that will give you items.
                These items will help you in different ways and make you stronger.
                All stages have a teleporter you need to activate, which will bring a boss.
                Killing the boss will give you an item, and fully activating the teleporter will allow you to move on to the next stage.

              <p>Persona 5 puts you into the shoes of a silent protagonist.
                After getting himself into a problem, he is forced to move to another place and live with a coffee shop owner.
              Being in a new place also forces the protagonist to go to a new school.
            It's in this school where everything changes.
          After making some friends, you and a new friend find yourself in a new world.
          The metaverse, the new world, is similar to the alternate worlds provided by the Persona series, but has some spice provided to keep it fresh.
          Persona 3's Dark Hour presented a seemingly endless tower to explore, and Persona 4's Midnight Chanenel provided explorable dungeons that would move the story along.
          It's Persona 4's Midnight Chanenel that Persona 5 improves on.</p>

              <p>Persona 5's Palaces provide larger dungeon enviroments to explore, and many puzzles inside of them.
              These palaces also move the story along, being vital important to the story and all having some important story moments inside of them.
              The palaces, much like the dungeons in Persona 4, move the story along.
              Unlike the dungeons though, you cannot revisit them after they're gone.

              <p> Later on, Persona 5 provides a type of location that is most similar to Persona 3's Dark Hour.
                Named Mementos, it allows you to explore a subway  that expands and goes deeper and deeper.
                Every time you come back, the layouts of each floor will change.
                Mementos is a great place for getting experience points, capturing personas, and getting money to spend on weapons and healing items.

                <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
              <p>
                Persona 5 is an amazing improvement on its series' forumla.
                It improves on the dungeons, battles, explorations, and a lot more, social links, systems, and benefits from those social links.
                Apart from that, Persona 5 is just an amazing game in general.
                Its stylish art will keep you looking at the screen and locations provided.
                Its even more stylish acid jazz soundtrack keeps everything fresh, and it'll keep you jamming and coming back to listen to the soundtrack.
                The cast of characters also help majorly in keeping the game enjoyable, from Ryuji Sakamoto, the first new friend you make and a very enthusiastic guy, to Sojiro Sakura, the owner of the coffee shop and a caring man, the characters keep the game fresh.
                Persona 5 has raised the bar for not only RPG's, but for the Persona series as a whole.
                Persona 5's other edition, The Royal, adds more content and improves even more on what Persona 5 has done, and may have even raised the bar higher.
