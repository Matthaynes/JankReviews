                    <p>Persona 5 starts you in an intense intro sequence, placing you and your team inside of a casino, with your goal being to get out of the casino.
                      This intro sequence is good for the player, as it introduces mechanics that will appear later on, such as hiding, ambushing enemies, and the way battles work.
                      As mentioned, part of this intro sequence is used as an oppurtunity to introduce the player to the combat system.
                      This is where Persona 5 shows its improvements on the forumlas provided by 2 of its predecessors, Persona 4 and Persona 3.

              <p>Persona 5's battle system has been simplified, with every option now being only one button press.
              This is much more convinient than Persona 3 and 4's battle options, those being menus you would have to scroll through to reach the option you wanted.
              This is also very innovative for the series as it makes very good use of the buttons, having the options on a good portion of them.</p>

              <p>Persona 5 puts you into the shoes of a silent protagonist.
                After getting himself into a problem, he is forced to move to another place to live with a coffee shop owner and also forces the protagonist to go to a new school.
          After making some friends, you and a new friend find yourself in a new world.
          The metaverse, Persona 5's new world, is similar to the alternate worlds provided by the Persona series, but has some spice provided to keep it fresh.
          Persona 3's Dark Hour presented a seemingly endless tower to explore, and Persona 4's Midnight Chanenel provided explorable dungeons that would move the story along.
          It's both Persona 4 and Persona 3's alternate worlds that Persona 5 improves on.</p>

              <p>Persona 5's Palaces provide larger dungeon enviroments to explore, and many puzzles inside of them.
              These palaces also move the story along, being vital important to the story and all having some important story moments inside of them.
              The palaces, much like the dungeons in Persona 4, move the story along.
              Unlike the dungeons though, you cannot revisit them after they're gone.

              <p> Later on, Persona 5 provides a type of location that is most similar to Persona 3's Dark Hour.
                Named Mementos, it allows you to explore a subway that expands and goes deeper and deeper.
                Every time you come back, the layouts of each floor will change.
                Mementos is a great place for getting experience points, capturing personas, and getting money to spend on weapons and healing items.

              <p>
                Persona 5 is an amazing improvement on its series' forumla.
                It improves on the dungeons, battles, explorations, and a lot more, social links, systems, and benefits from those social links.
                Apart from that, Persona 5 is just an amazing game in general.
                Its stylish art will keep you looking at the screen and locations provided and its even more stylish acid jazz soundtrack keeps everything fresh, and it'll keep you jamming and coming back to listen to the soundtrack.
                The cast of characters also help majorly in keeping the game enjoyable, from Ryuji Sakamoto, the first new friend you make and a very enthusiastic guy, to Sojiro Sakura, the owner of the coffee shop and a caring man, the characters keep the game fresh.
                Persona 5 has raised the bar for not only RPG's, but for the Persona series as a whole.
                Persona 5's other edition, Royal, adds more content and improves even more on what Persona 5 has done, and may have even raised the bar higher.
