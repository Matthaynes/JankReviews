                      Thanks to a recent update, you have immediate access to two characters, the Commando and Huntress.
                      You can also choose a difficulty and choose from unlockable items called artifacts that will affect your run in one way or another.
                      From making every enemy on a stage an elemental "elite" version, to majorly lowering your health in exchange for a lot more damage, the artifacts are fun to mess around with.

              <p> After choosing a character, you are thrusted into the world of Risk of Rain 2.
                There are multiple first stages that you can start off in Risk of Rain.
                You'll fight through many enemies and gain coins to open chests that will give you items.
                These items will help you in different ways and make you stronger.
                All stages have a teleporter you need to activate, which will spawn a boss and a field.
                Killing the boss will give you an item, and fully activating the teleporter will allow you to move on to the next stage.

              <p>Risk of Rain 2's main feature is the fact that as time goes on, the difficulty gets higher.
                The difficulty makes enemies harder to kill, but so long as you have your items, your power will end up evening out with the enemies.
                Certain items will also bring you high amounts of power, and getting these items early can make you extremely powerful

              Risk of Rain 2's many different environments are great to look at.
              Each housing different enemy types, it's fun to go through the stages and watch the different enemies you'll fight.
              It's also just fun to go through different environments for the first time and figure out how they work and how to navigate.
              At some point, though, enemies that would usually not spawn in an environment will start spawning in.
              This heavily adds to the fun and chaos Risk of Rain 2 is known and loved for.

                <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
              <p>
              Risk of Rain 2 is an amazing game that benefited majorly from a jump from to a 2D game to 3D game.
              It's a game that can get extremely chaotic, but in a very fun way.
              Looping through stages and watching the game change as the difficulty ramps up can keep an experience fresh.
              Playing with friends can also add many more layers of fun.
              With many different items, characters, and abilities, Risk of Rain 2 is possibly one of the best rougelike games out there right now.
              Being only $25, cheaper than many recent big but horribly failed releases, Risk of Rain 2 is a huge bargain.
              That bargain also becomes better when the game goes on sale, ususally for only $10.
              Even after pouring 340 hours into this game, it is still fun to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, and for one short or long run, or for many runs.

              <p>Survivors of the Void adds two characters, the Railgunner and the Void Fiend.
                The Railgunner brings a new mechanic.
                Railgunner has an ability that allows you to scope in, exposing critical spots on enemies.
                Hitting these spots will do major damage, and makes you reload, but if you can time your reload correctly, you'll have your shot back earlier.
                This reload mechanic is reminiscent of games like Star Wars Battlefront.
                The Second character, the Void Fiend, also brings a new mechanic.
                Sporting a corruption meter, this meter goes up when you take damage, and if it hits 100%, you'll turn into an enraged version of yourself.
                Your primary, instead of being a slow firing shot, now becomes a short range, fast damaging beam.
                Your phase ability now takes you forward instead of taking you up.
                You also sport another ability, being able to heal yourself from your corruption meter when uncorrupted, or taking health from yourself in order to stay in the corrupted mode.

              <p>Survivors of the Void also adds a new mode, Simulacrum.
                A new wave-based mode, you'll be put into a void-simulated version of already existing stages.
                You'll have to hold off 5 waves of enemies in activated fields, and you'll go through two of these fields each stage.
                This has also brought a smaller, but still important mechanic: being able to choose from three items.
                Once each wave ends, a small sphere will come out from the center of the field and you'll be able to choose from three different items.
                Waves can also be affected by the previously mentioned artifacts, now being called augments.
                These augments last for the one wave and will have the same effect as the artifacts, though, some augments can bring in the new void enemies or make you fight the first phase of the final boss of the game for a reward.
                The difficulty will also ramp up as time goes on, making waves more chaotic and may even crash or freeze your system.

              <p>
            Survivors of the Void is a great DLC that adds more to an already filled game.
            The additions are not just filler, though, they genuinely do improve Risk of Rain 2.
            This expansion has proved that more content can successfully be added, so long as the additions aren't there to just get the numbers up.
            Adding new content, such as the previously mentioned characters and Simulacrum, and new environments, enemies, items, and new "corrupted" items, Survivors of the Void is absolutely wonderful.
